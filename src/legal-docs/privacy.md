Unless otherwise stated, Baaboom is responsible for the processing of your personal data. You are always welcome to contact us if you have any questions about this policy or other issues related to data protection.

## What is personal data?

Personal data is information that can be directly or indirectly attributed to a physical person. Examples of such information are social security numbers, personal email addresses, telephone numbers and the like, but even encrypted data can be personal information if they can be linked to physical persons.

## What is processing of personal data?

Processing of personal data means any action that is carried out with personal data. This can be anything from collection and storage, to modification, use or deletion.

## When do we collect personal information about you?

Information you submit to us yourself
We collect and process personal information that you yourself provide to us when, for example, you use our services and participate in our events, contact us or use our digital channels.

Data from other sources
We may collect and process personal data shared with us by our partners and clients. In many of these cases, we are Personal Data Processors and perform the processing according to the partner's instructions.

We may also use third party services to collect and update your personal information.

Mainly, we process your personal data to:

## What legal basis do we have for the processing of your personal data?

In order to process your personal data, we must have a legal basis for this. Baaboom processes your personal information on the following grounds:

## How long do we keep your personal data?

Your personal data is only processed as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected - for example, as long as it is required for us to be able to fulfill the obligations we have as a result of an agreement with you. We may save the data longer if required by law or to safeguard our legal interests, e.g. whether a legal process is in progress.

Your personal data will be deleted or anonymized when they are no longer relevant to the purposes for which they have been collected.

## Who can we share your personal data with?

As a Personal Data Controller, we may share your information with our client in order to fulfill the obligations we have due to the Personal Data Processing agreement we have with them.

We may also share your personal data if necessary to establish, enforce and exercise Baaboom's legal interests.

We may also share your personal data when required by law or government regulation.

Your personal data is processed within the EU / EEA. In the event that we use service providers that transfer your personal data to countries outside the EU and the EEA, we will take steps to protect your personal data in accordance with applicable legal requirements, for example by demanding that the supplier protect the data in accordance with applicable data protection rules. If you would like to know more about what safeguards we have taken, please contact us.
